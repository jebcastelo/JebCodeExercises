	<blockquote>We serve from-scratch food made with excellent ingredients. At Jimmy John's our food is simple; it’s clean, and it’s fresh! We use locally purchased produce, which is brought in fresh and hand sliced daily. Our tuna salad is made from scratch by hand. Our real provolone cheese, oven-roasted turkey, choice top round roast beef, real wood-smoked ham, dry cured genoa salami, and spicy capicola, are also brought in fresh and sliced by hand daily – in every single Jimmy John's location.</blockquote>
